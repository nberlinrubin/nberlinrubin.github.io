Hi there! My name is Nina - I'm a 4th year PhD Candidate in Earth System Science at Stanford. My research focuses on human decision-making in the face of climate extremes like wildfires and hurricanes. I'm particularly interested in climate migration, geospatial analysis, and survey methods. 

My latest publication explores wildfire and wildfire-smoke associated migration intentions through a psychological lens: [As California burns: the psychology of wildfire- and wildfire smoke-related migration intentions](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11111-022-00409-w)

I received my bachelor's in Environmental Sciences & Policy with a minor in Global Health from Duke University. My [undergraduate thesis](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/19/7309) was a process evaluation of a malarial larviciding intervention - we show that small human behaviors make big differences in achieving intended goals.
