Hi there! My name is Nina - I'm a 4th year PhD Candidate in Earth System Science at Stanford. My research focuses on human decision-making in the face of climate extremes like wildfires and hurricanes. I'm particularly interested in climate migration, geospatial analysis, and survey methods. 

I received my bachelor's in Environmental Sciences & Policy with a minor in Global Health from Duke University. Prior to beginning at Stanford, I was a climate and energy analyst at ICF for the EPA's ENERGY STAR Program.
