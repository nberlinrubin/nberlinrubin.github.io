My name is Nina - I'm a fifth-year PhD Candidate in Earth System Science at Stanford University. My research focuses on human decision-making in the face of climate extremes such as wildfires and hurricanes, with a particular interest in individual-level adaptation to these threats. Currently, I'm working on projects including examining the relationship between people's past experiences and attachment to place with their future climate-related migration behavior; determining the effectiveness of proactive climate-related migration in reducing exposure to climate hazards; and assessing indoor air quality in households within frontline communities during the wildfire season. To address these aims, I use quantitative survey methodologies and geospatial analysis.

Before starting my graduate degree, I worked as a climate and energy analyst for the Environmental Protection Agency's ENERGY STAR Program at a consulting company in Washington, D.C. called ICF. I received my bachelor's degree in Environmental Sciences & Policy with a minor in Global Health from Duke University.
