**Nina Berlin Rubin** and Gabrielle Wong-Parodi. As California burns: the psychology of wildfire- and wildfire smoke-related migration intentions. *Population and Environment*, 2022 \[[pdf](http://nberlinrubin.github.io/files/paper1.pdf)\]

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
In this study, we sought to better understand how <i>perceptions of</i> and <i>experiences with</i> wildfire and wildfire smoke are associated with future intentions to migrate among California residents. Among those planning to migrate, we found that the perceived severity of the health impacts of wildfire smoke and prior negative outcomes (e.g., losing property to wildfire, having health harmed by wildfire smoke) were positively associated with how much residents said wildfire/smoke impacted their decision to move.

Gabrielle Wong-Parodi and **Nina Berlin Rubin**. Exploring how climate change subjective attribution, personal experience with extremes, concern, and subjective knowledge relate to pro-environmental attitudes and behavioral intentions in the United States. *Journal of Environmental Psychology*, 2022 \[[pdf](http://nberlinrubin.github.io/files/paper2.pdf)\]

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
Using two national surveys of United States adults, we examine how attribution of wildfires (and separately, COVID-19) and subjective knowledge about climate change are associated with pro-environmental behavioral intentions and attitudes. Results demonstrate that personal experience & knowledge are associated with higher climate change attribution, and that attribution is associated with pro-environmental behavioral intentions and attitudes.

Process Evaluation of a Community-Based Microbial Larviciding Intervention for Malaria Control in Rural Tanzania. *International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health*, 2020 \[[pdf](http://nberlinrubin.github.io/files/paper4.pdf)\]

<p style="margin-left: 25px;">
This study evaluates the implementation of a community-based microbial larviciding intervention aimed at reducing mosquito breeding habitats with the ultimate goal of reducing malarial spread in rural Tanzania. This was my undergraduate honors thesis, which I revised and published in the years following graduation.
